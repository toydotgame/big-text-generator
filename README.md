# Big Text Generator
###### A port to Java made by toydotgame
I made this because why not. The entire concept is from [Redo122/Big-Text-Generator](https://github.com/Redo122/Big-Text-Generator).

**Development works like this:** Redo122 adds a feature or fixes a large bug, and I then port his changes to Java. Pretty simple. For the sake of not being a total scam, I'll fix my own bugs and probably change some methods to be a bit nicer than the minimal original C# code.

This version started at `v1.2` of upstream.
